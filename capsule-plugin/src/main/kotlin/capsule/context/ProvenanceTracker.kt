/**
 * Mutable accumulator of capsule context provenance (CAP-PROVENANCE).
 *
 * [CollectCapsuleAugmentedContextTask] tracks the sources per channel as it
 * assembles the composite context, passes this tracker to
 * [CapsuleContextBuilder.build] (which prunes the channels that did not
 * survive the budget via [retainOnly]), then freezes the result with
 * [build] and serialises it ([ContextProvenance.toJson]).
 *
 * The tracker is deliberately NOT a pure object — it accumulates state during
 * the build. [build] returns an immutable [ContextProvenance] snapshot, so a
 * later [trackChannel] call never mutates an already-frozen snapshot.
 *
 * [trackChannel] replaces the sources of a repeated channel (last write wins)
 * and ignores an empty source list (a channel with no source is not recorded).
